   The CPI stack which follows breaks down the final CPI of the run into 
   various CPI components.  The view is from the front end of the machine back.
   In each cycle the machine either completes a group or does not, so for
   each cycle in which no group completed the timer will try and account for why.
   There are 3 modes of counting.  The first is when there are no groups waiting
   to complete (groups begin waiting as soon as they are dispatched).  During this
   time the pipeline is empty and the cycles will be counted in a bucket under 
   "pipeline_empty".  The second mode of counting occurs when a group has been
   dispatched and is waiting to complete but has experienced no stall events in the
   pipelines so the cycles are counted under "pipeline_refill".  The final and
   most common mode of counting is when there are groups waiting to complete and they
   experienced stall conditions during their lifetime. If the group cannot complete
   on the cycle in which it became eligible the timer will look back over the life of all
   instructions in the group starting with dispatch and moving towards finish and it
   will find the instruction within that group that went the deepest into the machine
   before encountering a stall condition.  The timer will then begin examining the
   stall events that happened to that instruction beginning with dispatch and
   incrementing that reasons bucket and decrement that stall condition.  If that
   instruction's stalls are exhausted before the group completes the next instruction
   will be chosen in a similar manner.  If there is a tie the older instruction is
   chosen.  On the cycle when a group does completes it is counted in the 
   "Complete_current_grp" bucket.

   In the end the timer has made a count for each cycle simulated in one of the many
   reason counts.  This allows the timer to figure the fraction of the CPI for various
   stalls.  This can be used to compare against similar runs to provide insight into the
   behavior of the machine.  Please note that not all stall reasons are valid for a given
   timer configuration.

   Here is a break down of the various reason counts:
